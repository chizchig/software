            <h2>Bible Verses</h2>
            <h3>Psalm 91</h3>
            <p>Safety of Abiding in the Presence of God
                91 He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High
                Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
                2 I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress;
                My God, in Him I will trust.”
                
                3 Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the [a]fowler
                And from the perilous pestilence.
                4 He shall cover you with His feathers,
                And under His wings you shall take refuge;
                His truth shall be your shield and [b]buckler.
                5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,
                Nor of the arrow that flies by day,
                6 Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,
                Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.
                
                7 A thousand may fall at your side,
                And ten thousand at your right hand;
                But it shall not come near you.
                8 Only with your eyes shall you look,
                And see the reward of the wicked.
                
                9 Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge,
                Even the Most High, your dwelling place,
                10 No evil shall befall you,
                Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling;
                11 For He shall give His angels charge over you,
                To keep you in all your ways.
                12 In their hands they shall bear you up,
                Lest you dash your foot against a stone.
                13 You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra,
                The young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot.
                
                14 “Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him;
                I will set him on high, because he has known My name.
                15 He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him;
                I will be with him in trouble;
                I will deliver him and honor him.
                16 With [f]long life I will satisfy him,
                And show him My salvation.”</p>
            <h3>Psalm 23</h3>
            <p>The Lord is my shepherd;
                I shall not [a]want.
                2 He makes me to lie down in [b]green pastures;
                He leads me beside the still waters.
                3 He restores my soul;
                He leads me in the paths of righteousness
                For His name’s sake.
                
                4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
                I will fear no evil;
                For You are with me;
                Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.
                
                5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
                You anoint my head with oil;
                My cup runs over.
                6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
                All the days of my life;
                And I will [d]dwell in the house of the Lord
                Forever.</p>
            <h3>Psalm 27:1-2</h3>
            <p>A Psalm of David.
                27 The Lord is my light and my salvation;
                Whom shall I fear?
                The Lord is the strength of my life;
                Of whom shall I be afraid?
                2 When the wicked came against me
                To eat up my flesh,
                My enemies and foes,
                They stumbled and fell.</p>
